### 5. Course(s) corresponding to Programming 

```markdown
**Introduction to Computing (2012-2013 Semester2)**
This course provides an introduction to the concept of computational complexity. 
It also investigate basic sorting algorithms and analysis their computational complexity,
such as Quicksort, Merge sort and Insertion sort.

**Computer Programming 1 (2013-2014 Semester1)**
The course covers the basic grammar of C++ and programming concepts including procedural
programming, basic control structures (sequence, if/else, for loop, while loop), array, 
struct and pointer. Introduction to object-oriented programming is also introduced.

**Computer Programming 2 (2013-2014 Semester2)**
This course aims to familiarize students with C# and advanced concepts of object-oriented 
programming. It covers design and implementation of class, creating and initializing 
objects (providing initial values member variables), inheritance of public and protected 
classes and file processing.

**Computer Organization (2015-2016 Semester2)**
This course covers the SW/HW organization of modern computer systems. Students will learn 
how to design the main components of a computer system and how to control these components 
through SW. To consolidate the material presented in class, students will work on programming 
and datapath design assignments. The final project will work on the optimization of a resource 
constrained computer system.

**Introduction to Pattern Recognition (2015-2016 Semester2)**
This course deals with the classification and clustering of data. It covers decision theory, 
statistical classification, maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation, nonparametric methods, 
unsupervised learning and clustering etc.

**Introduction to Embedded Systems Design and Implementation (2015-2016 Semester2)**
This course introduces hardware and software platforms of embedded system fors designing and
development through a series of labs on modules concerning image processing and so on. This
course provides practical experiences on embedded system design and implementation for students.

### 6. Course(s) corresponding to Algorithms and Data Structures 

```markdown
**Data Structures and Algorithms(A) (2014-2015 Semester1)**
Data Structure and Algorithms is the fundamental core course of computer science. This
course covers the concepts of common data structure such as linear table, stack, leap,
tree, graph and their impletations. This course also introduces sorting and indexing 
algorithms. And basics of algorithm complexity analysis are also included in the course.
